Everyone loves to buy and sell stuff, but we need a shop for that!
In this project, the goal is to build one of the most common type of websites on the web:
an online eCommerce web-application, where users can not only browse products, add them into a Shopping Cart, checkout items and make payments,
but can also log in and see the abandoned shopping cart or their order history.
